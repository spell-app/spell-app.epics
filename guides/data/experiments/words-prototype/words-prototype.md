# Words Prototype:  every proposed line, tried on the real parser

Epic `data`, P10, 2026-10-31.  T8:  the first time any proposed Spell line was compiled.

- What it's from:  [wordsPrototype.test.ts](/parser/tests/spell/parserTests/wordsPrototype.test.ts), which pins each row.
  `WORDS_TABLE=<path> yarn vp test run --project spell tests/spell/parserTests/wordsPrototype.test.ts` writes the table below.
- The rules that read the new lines:  [wordsPrototype.rules.ts](/parser/tests/spell/parserTests/wordsPrototype.rules.ts).
  They're on a clone of the parser, for that test alone.  No project sees them, and they compile to a call nothing defines.
- So "compiles with a rule" means a line can be READ, among the rules there are, with no collision.
  It doesn't mean it does anything yet.  Connecting words to places is The Words (P11).
- What really runs:  `every recipe where ...`, `..., sorted by ...`, and the lines marked "ran" in the Note column.

## What it found, that nobody expected

1. **A line that compiles can be wrong.**  Five proposed lines compile today to something else, with no error:
   - `when someone else changes it:` => an event of that name, which never comes (o3 feared a property;  it's an event)
   - `when a recipe changes:` => the event `a-recipe-changes`, which nobody sends
   - `the total of its prices` => a property called `total`, which isn't there
   - `its cook is "Ana" or "Bo"`, which the Overview said already works, and `is either "Ana" or "Bo"` => always true:  every recipe (I13)
2. **`is saved in` collides with `is saved in its own file`.**  With any expression after `in`, `its own` reads as a property.
   Only a place's name may follow.
3. **`draw the recipe` in a loop draws nothing** (I14), so the Overview's shelf would be empty.
4. **`to publish (a recipe) is at "..."` can't compile** (Q14's form):  `to ...` takes every word up to the text as a name.  Q17.
5. **`cancel search` inside a handler is today's `cancel <event>`**, and drops the name.
6. **`save the draft`:  the Overview's own box has a `draft`, a text.**  It's refused, saying there's no save step.
7. **A saved type is known only below its declaration.**  A line above sees just the name, as every type is stubbed.
8. **`cada receta, ordenadas por`** can't agree (J58).
9. What held up better than feared:  every kind of place reads, both languages, multi-word kinds with `at` and `de` in them,
   `each person's own at protocol account`, `a recipe's title is called`.  Kinds as types (Q2) work:  a test adds `a supabase project`.

## I1's cause

Two causes, one behind the other:
- `its "m" is recipes in its stuff where ...` read as a stored property of type `recipes`, then words nothing reads.
  A rule's priority is compared before its length, and the stored property's is higher.
  - Only that shape failed:  `its "m" is the recipes in ...`, and `"m" is recipes in ...`, always worked.
  - Fixed:  a stored property's line said with `its` that stops short of its line gives way (J57).
- `every recipe where ...` and `..., sorted by ...` didn't exist in any form.  Added, English and Spanish.

## What The Words must decide

1. `every recipe` for a saved type:  it has to know the type is saved while it's parsed, as the waiting pass needs to.
   Note it with the stubs, before a project parses, as a type's name is.  Or have a line above the type mean memory, which is wrong.
2. Q17:  how a named operation is said.
3. What `where` and `sorted by` compile to for a saved type:  today `core.filter(core.everyThing(T), fn)` runs a function per item,
   and a place wants a filter it can hand on.  Recognising the simple shapes at compile time is the choice.
4. `belongs to one`:  the prototype takes a non-list owner only if it's saved.  The Overview's `ingredient` itself says nothing of a place:
   does belonging to a saved recipe make it saved, and where's its `the recipe of an ingredient` kept?
5. I13:  what `is "Ana" or "Bo"` means, and `either` with text.  I14:  `draw the x` as a drawn line.  I15:  a sort key that waits.
6. `cancel search` in a handler:  an action's name should win over an event's, when it declares one.
7. Riders attach to the read above them, as `otherwise` does to its `if`.  The prototype only reads them, one line at a time.
8. Spanish:  gender in `ninguna`, `otra persona lo cambia`, `ordenada`;  `para quitar eso` rather than `para quitarla`;  every word through the glossary.
9. `sortedBy()`'s text order ignores case, and takes no account of accents, in either core:  `ñ` sorts after `z`.
10. What drives the things:  `thingsFrom()` only runs when called (J20), so a read needs a memo or link to call it, and `result.leave()` when it's gone.
    Actions reach writes by `core.runAction()`, `core.meanwhile()`.  None of this was tried here:  connecting is P11's.

## The table

"wrong":  compiles, to something else.  With a rule, each line is only read, as above.
