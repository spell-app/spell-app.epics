 * - GraphQL says none:  the last save wins that field.
 *   - Both are one CSV file on the servers, so `graphql` has the same recipes as `rest`.
 * - A folder is only reachable through a server side, `RemotePlace`:  it has versions, so a clash merges per field.
 *   - A room's referee keeps its recipes in that same folder.
 * - A sheet is a CSV file at an address (`sheet`), read only, with no server of ours:  this page's own, or a Google Sheet
 *   shared with "anyone with the link".
 *   - `sheet-no-id`:  the same file, with nothing saying which row is which.
 * - `sheet-server`:  the servers' own CSV file with a place server in front (`CsvPlace`), so it takes writes:  each save changes only
 *   the lines that changed, and it reads as a position, so a recipe can move.
 * - A Google Sheet to write to goes through a server side, which holds its key:  the last save wins each cell.
 * - This device needs no server, and only this browser ever sees them.
 * - A room has a referee putting everyone's changes in one order, over a websocket:  so nothing polls, and it heals itself.
 * - `atmosphere`:  each person's own records, on their own host, put together, on `FakeAtmosphere`:  no real account.  Sign in as `alice.test` or `bob.test`.
 * - `atmosphere-real`:  the real network, and a real sign-in:  your own account's records, which are public.  Manual test M3.

 * ### `RecipeBox`
 * The component behind `<recipe-box>`, the data epic's demo:  recipes in a place, and nothing about the server but `BACK_ENDS`.
 * - One read (`PlaceResult`), asked again every few seconds while the page shows (`pollWhileVisible()`).
 * - A place that takes no writes shows as text, with nothing to press:  it asks the place (`writeAnswerFor()`), never which back-end it is.
 * - What a read says about its rows (`PlaceResult.notes`) is shown as it is.
 * - Every write goes through `PendingChanges`:  shown at once, sent soon, in order.
 * - In a room nothing polls:  what others do arrives (`PlaceHeal.follow()`), and it can add to a number, move a recipe,
 *   and say when someone deleted what you're changing.
 * - Use a sample:  editable records in place of the place, with nothing above it changed, and nothing reaching the place
 *   (`useSample()`).  It's what the editor's side bar will offer, for a read-only or slow place.
 * - A GUIDE-ONLY element:  built into `recipe-box.bundle.js` by `epic/src/tools/bundle-experiment.ts`, on the page's Spell UI.
