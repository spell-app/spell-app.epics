/**
 * Step 1 of the custom elements guide's teaching element:  the VOCABULARY of `<ui-counter>`.
 * - Every name the tag uses lives here, and only here:  its tag, attributes, events, slots, parts, states and texts.
 *   The component never writes one as a string;  it reads them through its vocabulary.
 * - The shape is Spell UI's `E.ComponentVocabulary`;  `as const` keeps every name a literal type,
 *   so `this.count` is typed and a misspelt part name fails TypeScript.
 * - A GUIDE-ONLY element (`guides/custom-elements/experiments/`):  not part of Spell UI, its site or its bundles.
